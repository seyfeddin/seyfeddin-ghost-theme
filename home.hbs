      Hello!
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a software developer with an understanding of design. For the last 8.5 years, I’m focused on making great products for Apple devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offscreen, I'm an avid for good tea, coffee and fantasy fiction books. I mostly listen to 70<small>s</small> Prog Rock and play drums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I've released 10+ native iOS apps, many more web apps, founded <a href="http://nsistanbul.com">NSIstanbul</a>, and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/seyfoyun">gave talks at meetups</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I aim to work on projects that are useful, ethically responsible and well-crafted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my space where I <a href="/writing">publish articles</a>, <span class="disabled">suggest books</span><span class="description"> (soon)</span> and <span class="disabled">display my work</span><span class="description"> (also very soon)</span>.
